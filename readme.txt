This project is a simple one that measures the performance
characteristics of some simple type reflection (that happen to 
be optimized by the JIT compiler). 

To build the code you only need Version 2.0 of the .NET Runtime installed.  

If you have this you can simply invoke 'buildIt.bat' to build the code.
